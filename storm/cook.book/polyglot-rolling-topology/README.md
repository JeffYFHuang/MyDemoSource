# Polyglot Rolling Topology

This example demonstrates the multi language capabilities of storm. It is a bit of a toy example, but it does illustrate things well.

Essentially it is an implementation of the rolling word count example from the storm starter project, however the topology is implemented in Clojure, some of the bolts are implemented in C++ and some in Ruby.
